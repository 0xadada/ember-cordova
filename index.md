ember-cordova compiles Ember applications into native mobile apps, e.g. iOS and Android, leveraging Cordova. Support is for Ember 1.13+ and node 0.12+.

The project involves a CLI to:

- Build/Package Ember/Cordova/Crosswalk applications;

- On-device livereload for development apps;

- Run apps on devices/emulators;

- Automated icon & splash generation;

- Other helpful CLI actions, such as default plugin saves;


and also:

- A service for detecting device platform; and

- A growing ecosystem of plugin bindings.
